Hi all, I'm Mick-(micky13613).
Found this place very helpful with my new hobby, 3d printing!
Still pretty new to the process, but eager to master it. 
As I'm still finding my way, anyone that would be kind enough to give any help or supportive advice regarding upgrading and improving printer performance, it would be appreciated and welcomed.
Thanks if you have taken the time to read this. Printers I have are Creality Ender 3 Pro with 4.2.2 board and Flsun Q5 stock parts with 2.5 firmware and functioning WiFi.
